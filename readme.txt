== Description ==

This plugin provides a way to take online registrations for events such as conference and seminars that are held live. It uses the PayPal and Authorize.net IPNs to record payments to a database.

This WordPress plugin is designed to run on a WordPress webpage and provide registration for an event. It allows you to capture the registering persons contact information to a database and provides an association to an events database. It provides the ability to send the registrant to your PayPal payment page for online collection of event fees. PayPal and Authorize.net payments are captured to the database using the PayPal and Authorize.net IPNs. Events are sorted by date and a short code is provided to display a single event or category of events on a page.

Reporting features provide a list of events, list of attendees, and excel export.

I have made several changes to this plugin in the last few months. Quite a bit has changed in the code and database tables. If you are upgrading from a previous version of this plugin, be sure to back up your current installation of this plugin. It is also a good idea to backup your WordPress database as well. If you have modified the original code of your current installation you definitely want to make a backup of your existing plugin. I would even suggest installing the plugin on a test version of WordPress.
