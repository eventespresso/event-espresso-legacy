event-espresso-legacy
=====================

This is the 3.1 branch of Event Espresso
http://eventespresso.com

## VERY IMPORTANT

This repository is offered as a means for developers to use and contribute pull requests if they desire.  However, this is considered a legacy product so we will ONLY be accepting pull requests for the following:

- bug fixes
- security fixes

Also **this repository is NOT a support portal**.  If you have questions about how to do something, you can post an issue if you want but you will not get a response from any of the Event Espresso team.  Due to this being a legacy product, support for EE3 user's is ONLY provided to holder's of a EE3 support license via the [Event Espresso support forums](https://eventespresso.com/support/forums)
